<a name="welcome" class="anchor" href="#welcome"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome!!!</h1>

<p>My name is David Silva, born and raised in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisbon">Lisbon</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh3W1_x7KbY">Portugal</a>. I've always had a passion for software and technology. I love to create software to make people's lives easier, simpler and fun!</p>

<p>I've been working as a Web Developer since mid 2009, and with Ruby on Rails since December 2010, since then I couldn't go back, I fell in love with the simplicity of the language and how Ruby on Rails could make web development seem so easy!</p>

</h3>

<p>I used to work as developer, in a team of 5 members, 4 Developers (counting 1 Lead Developer) and 1 Product Manager. Our goal was to make our Hosts have the best experience when publishing their own property.</p>

<p>Here at HouseTrip we like to think before we act, we discuss new features and how we can we bring more value by building new features as a team. That's one of the things I felt in love when I joined - we discuss, we plan and we build together!</p>

<p>There is teamwork, and there is no such thing as being stuck during days with some problem, we work as a team and we solve problems together.</p>
