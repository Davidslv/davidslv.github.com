<p>My name is David Silva, born and raised in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisbon">Lisbon</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh3W1_x7KbY">Portugal</a>. I've always had a passion for software and technologies. I love to create software to make people's lives easier, simple and funny!</p>

<p>I've been living in London since January 2013, I moved here some days after my birthday, to work with this great company that is <a href="http://housetrip.com">HouseTrip</a>. I've been working with some of the best developers I ever met and I can say I've been learning a lot with them since the beginning of the year, and I can't stop absorving their knowledge everyday.</p>

</h3>

<p>As as developer, I work with 5 team members, 4 Developers (counting 1 Lead Developer) and 1 Product Manager. Our goal is to make our Hosts to have the best experience when publishing their own property in our platform!</p>

<p>Here at HouseTrip we like to think before we act, we discuss new features and how we can we bring more value by building a new feature as a team. That's one of the things I felt in love when I joined - we discuss, we plan and we build together!</p>

<p>There is teamwork, and there is no such thing of being stuck during days with some problem, we work as a team and we solve problems together!</p>
