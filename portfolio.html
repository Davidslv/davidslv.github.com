        <div class="project-description">
          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>Vanilla Roguelike is a roguelike game written in vanilla Ruby, inspired by the original 1980's Rogue game. It features procedurally generated mazes, player movement, and a flexible architecture based on the Entity-Component-System pattern with an event-driven system for logging and debugging.</p>
          <h2>Motivation</h2>
          <p>I've always been fascinated by roguelike games and their procedural generation techniques. This project started as a way to understand game development fundamentals, but it evolved into something much more: an educational journey that I wanted to share with others.</p>
          <div class="book-section">
            <h2>Educational Book</h2>
            <p>Based on my experience building Vanilla Roguelike, I authored a comprehensive book that teaches readers how to build their own roguelike game from scratch. The book covers:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Game architecture and design patterns</li>
              <li>Entity-Component-System implementation</li>
              <li>Procedural generation algorithms</li>
              <li>Event-driven architecture</li>
              <li>Testing strategies for game development</li>
              <li>Performance optimization techniques</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The goal is to make game development accessible to developers who want to learn by building something tangible and engaging. Whether you're new to game development or looking to understand roguelike mechanics, this book provides a practical, hands-on approach to learning.</p>

          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>Manuscript Forge is a work-in-progress platform designed to help writers manage, organize, and refine their manuscripts. It provides tools for version control, collaboration, and structured writing workflows.</p>
          <h2>Motivation</h2>
          <p>The idea for Manuscript Forge came from recognizing the challenges writers face when managing long-form content. Traditional word processors aren't designed for the iterative, collaborative nature of writing projects. I'm building this platform to provide writers with the tools they need to focus on what matters most: their writing.</p>
