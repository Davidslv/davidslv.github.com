{"name":"Davidslv","tagline":"Ruby Developer @HouseTrip","body":"# Welcome!!!\r\nMy name is David Silva, born and raised in [Lisbon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisbon), [Portugal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh3W1_x7KbY). I've always had a passion for software and technologies. I love to create software to make people's lives easier, simple and funny!\r\n\r\nI've been working as a Web Developer since mid 2009, and with Ruby on Rails since December 2010, since then I couldn't go back, I felt in love with the simplicity of the language and how Ruby on Rails could make web development seem so easy!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Living in London\r\nI've been living in London since January 2013, I moved here some days after my birthday, to work with this great company that is [HouseTrip](http://housetrip.com). I've been working with some of the best developers I ever met and I can say I've been learning a lot with them since the beginning of the year, and I can't stop absorving their knowledge everyday.\r\n\r\n### @HouseTrip\r\nAs as developer, I work with 5 team members, 4 Developers (counting 1 Lead Developer) and 1 Product Manager. Our goal is to make our Hosts to have the best experience when publishing their own property in our platform!\r\n\r\nHere at HouseTrip we like to think before we act, we discuss new features and how we can we bring more value by building a new feature as a team. That's one of the things I felt in love when I joined - we discuss, we plan and we build together!\r\n\r\nThere is teamwork, and there is no such thing of being stuck during days with some problem, we work as a team and we solve problems together!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tech Fridays\r\nYes, we do have Tech Fridays (Yeah!!!), we use them to work with different people and build better tools for us and for the bussiness. *We invest in paying back our technical debt.*\r\n\r\n### Where can you find me?\r\n\r\nTwitter: [@davidslv](http://twitter.com/davidslv), LinkedIn: [davidslv](http://www.linkedin.com/in/davidslv)","google":"UA-26367594-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
