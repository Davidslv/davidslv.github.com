It's really hard to talk about myself, the first time I remember using a computer
was still MS-DOS, I was about 6 years old and I remember loving the sound of
keyboard keys (which I still do), basically someone had the idea of getting two
computers for our school, the thing was that no adult knew how they worked, I
think it's needless to say how things went, being part of a generation that was
starting to have electronic gadgets like for example the Game Boy it didn't took
us that long to figure out how to interact with the computer and soon we were all
playing games.

Not long after I got my first computer back in 1998, [Pentium 3 650Mhz](http://ark.intel.com/products/27547/Intel-Pentium-III-Processor-650-MHz-256K-Cache-100-MHz-FSB)
with 256MB RAM and 9.2GB of HDD, and of course came with [Windows 98](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_98).
Since I wanted to master the keyboard and type without looking into the keys I
started writing stories and sometimes just copy some excerpts of text I
would read in a book, of course games helped but in a different way, I think
they triggered the developer inside of me, I wanted to learn how to build them,
but it was 1999-2000 and I was the first one in the family to have the need for
more but there wasn't any resources I could use, there wasn't internet in my house,
and I didn't had access to any IT magazines that could have existed at that time.

Anyway... I don't want to bother you too much with my childhood.

Nowadays I'm a Ruby developer, lately more a back-end than a full-stack,
I feel that I belong on the back-end, there's so much to learn and master from
a programming perspective, I love to improve my programming skills all the time,
and seriously even though I like to do front-end there are people with better
knowledge than me and no doubt they will deliver a better final product.

I'm interested in several topics like security, game development, web development,
scalability, algorithms, programming best practices and architecture
(with no particular order of mention).
